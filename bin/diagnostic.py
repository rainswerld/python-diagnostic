# Question 1:
# Say you want to name a variable to replace the phrase
# "Favorite Star Wars Movie"
# Set the `variable` below to be a string of how you would name that
# variable according to python naming conventions.
# Replace `None` with your answer
variable = 'favorite_star_wars_movie'

# Question 2:
# Examine the following code.

batman = 'Bruce Wayne'

if batman:
  'The Dark Knight'
else:
  'Just your average billionaire'

# What value will be returned? Write your response as a Python string below.
# Replace `None` with your answer

flow = 'The Dark Knight'

# Question 3:
# Create a template string based on the given variables which reads
# "My name is Steve and I like strawberry pie during the summer."
# Replace `None` with your answer

name = 'Steve'
pie = 'strawberry pie'
season = 'summer'

template = f"My name is {name} and I like {pie} during the {season}."

# Question 4:
# Run the Python script named `message.py` in this directory.
# No need to look at the code in that file. What did it print to the terminal?
# Paste the output of that script below, replacing `None`.

message = 'Look at that, you CAN run a python script!'

# Question 5:

# In a Python string, write what keyword you use for "else if" clauses in
# Python. Replace `None` with your answer below:

else_if = 'elif'

# Question 6:

# In a Python string, write what we call the triple-quotes strings used to
# document functions and files in Python scripts. Replace `None` with your
# answer below:

triple_quotes = 'docstrings'

# Question 7:

# Given the following list:

my_list = [12, 34, 56, 67] # Don't modify this line!

# Write code that will modify the array above by removing the last two elements.

# Your code here
# my_list.pop()
# my_list.pop()
my_list = my_list[0:len(my_list) - 2]

remove_from_list = my_list # Don't modify this line either!

# Question 8:

# This line makes a copy of `list` as it looks after you've removed the last
# two elements
new_list = my_list.copy() # Don't modify this line!

# Modify `new_arr` by adding the number 99 as the third element in the list.

# your code here
new_list.append(99)

add_to_list = new_list # Don't touch me

# Question 9:

# Instantiate a `person` dictionary with `favorite_number` and `first_name`
# keys and a favorite number and a first name as their respective values.
# Replace `None` below with the dictionary.

person_dictionary = {
  'favorite_number': 3,
  'first_name': 'Eron'
}

# Question 10:

# Fill in the method below so that it reverses the string passed in as `text`,
# changes all the letters to uppercase, and returns the modified string.

# For example: "hello" => "OLLEH"

# We haven't taught you any of this!

def normalize(text):
  # your code here
  print(text)
  letters = list(text.upper())
  letters.reverse()
  return "".join(letters)
